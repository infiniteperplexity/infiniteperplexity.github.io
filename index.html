<h1>An overview of my GitHub projects.</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Glenn Wright and I'm a data scientist by trade, but not all of my projects are data science projects.</p>
<h4>Writing:</h4>
<a href="http://infiniteperplexity.github.io/concepts.html">A brief, but possibly open-ended, series I wrote on lesser-known programming concepts.</a>
<br>

<h4>Repos:</h4>
<h2>VisualSpinner3D <code>(visual-spinner-3d)</code></h2>
<p>The most comprehensive existing visualizer and simulator for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqemAYhTi9Q">flow artists.</a>  It can be used to visualize almost any sequence of movements for any number of flow props, allowing users to plan routines and analyze geometric movements.  Sequences of movements are serializable as JSON.  The engine is written in JavaScript, and several visualization options are available, including <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">HTML5 Canvas</a> and <a href="http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/phoria/">phoria.js</a>.  The project is open-ended, but largely finished.  Featured on <a href="http://www.spinmorepoi.com/">Spin More Poi.</a>  More information is available on the <a href="http://infiniteperplexity.github.io/visual-spinner-3d/">project page.</a></p>
<h2>Hecatomb <code>(hecatomb)</code></h2>
<p>Hecatomb is a rogue-like, fortress-building game inspired by games like <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> and <a href="http://keeperrl.com/">KeeperRL</a>, built in JavaScript using the <a href="http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/">ROT.js</a> library. The player controls a necromancer that summons and commands zombies to build a lair and fight off the marauding forces of good.  Currently, the game runs on the desktop using <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron.</a>  The project has seen limited playtesting but is currently in the pre-alpha stage of development.</p>
<h2>Laser-cut algorithmic snowflakes <code>(laserflakes)</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> code for my relatively popular <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-cut-algorithmic-snowflakes/">Instructable.</a>  The instructable contains instructions for generating images of snowflakes, each one unique, and converting them to vector diagrams using <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a>, compatible with most laser cutters.  The snowflakes are generated using an algorithm loosely inspired by randomized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L-systems.</a>  The project is complete.</p>
<h2>Arduino-based LED projects <code>(light-and-motion)</code></h2>
<p>Code for three projects using the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>-compatible <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> microcontroller and various motion sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses) to create motion-sensitive LED <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqemAYhTi9Q">flow props.</a> Projects are complete. Code is written in a subset of C++.</p>

<h2>Lisp-to-JavaScript transpiler <code>(lisp2js)</code></h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.  A project to teach myself Lisp and understand how parsing and lexing work, and to ensure that I understand syntactic macros.  Written in JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Don't Starve mods <code>(dontstarvemods)</code></h2>
<p>Two simple mod packs, written in <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, for the Klei Entertainment games <a href="https://www.klei.com/games/dont-starve">Don't Starve</a> and <a href="https://www.klei.com/games/dont-starve-together">Don't Starve Together.</a>  One is complete and available on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1311380220&searchtext=butterfly+hunter">Steam Workshop</a>; the other is in development.</p>
<h2>Our Fading Reefs<code>(coral-bleaching-led-project)</code></h2>
<p>An LED installation driven by forty years of ocean temperature recorded at coral reefs around the world.  When representing temperatures healthy for corals, the installation glows in rainbow colors, but when representing temperatures that are too hot, it fades to a ghostly white, paralleling how <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html">coral bleaches</a> in harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>Assorted code for training small language models<code>(ai-tooling)</code></h2>
<p>PyTorch code exploring a variety of different languages modeling architectures, with an emphasis on linear alternatives to transformers.</p>
